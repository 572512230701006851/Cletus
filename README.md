## Editing

This bot (and the source code here) may not be easy to edit for inexperienced progammers. The main purpose of having the source code public is to show the capabilities of the libraries, allow inexperienced programmers have a visual representation of how programming should be written, and to allow those knowledgeable about nodeJS, discord.js, and Discord bot development to contribute. There are many requirements and dependencies required to edit and compile it, and there will not be support provided for people looking to make changes on their own. Instead, consider making a feature request. If you choose to make edits, please do so in accordance with the Apache 2.0 License.
